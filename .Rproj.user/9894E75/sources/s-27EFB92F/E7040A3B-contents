##  Windows Virtual Desktop

The University of Bristol offers you to access a university computer remotely. Follow the steps below to log on. 

#### Step 1: Go to UoB IT support {-}

Go to [www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/it/](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/it/) using a browser like Google Chrome, Safari, or Microsoft Edge.

```{r,  include=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=c(" "), out.width="90%", fig.show='hold',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./graphics/remote_access/fig_r1.png")
```

#### Step 2: Locate the student remote desktop {-}

Scroll to the bottom of the page and find the two (identical) links to the student remote desktop. Click on one of these links (or the link  [here](https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/itservices/SitePages/student-remote-desktop.aspx)).

```{r,  include=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=c(" "), out.width="90%", fig.show='hold',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./graphics/remote_access/fig_r2.png")
```

#### Step 3: Enter your university e-mail address and follow the steps to log in (this process is similar to the process for installing Office, explained above). {-}
```{r,  include=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=c(" "), out.width="90%", fig.show='hold',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./graphics/remote_access/fig_r4.png")
```

#### Step 4: "Remote Access Solutions for Students and Teaching" {-}

You should now be at the website called "Remote Access Solutions for Students and Teaching" 
Click on **"Windows Virtual Desktop"** 

```{r,  include=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=c(" "), out.width="90%", fig.show='hold',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./graphics/remote_access/r1.png")
```

#### Step 5: Access a virtual remote desktop via the wew {-}

Click on the link to log on to the virtual remote desktop. As you've already logged in to your UoB account above, you don't need to do it again here. 

```{r,  include=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=c(" "), out.width="90%", fig.show='hold',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./graphics/remote_access/r2.png")
```

#### Step 6: Open the virtual desktop {-}

Now click on the "Open Access" Icon. 

```{r,  include=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=c(" "), out.width="90%", fig.show='hold',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./graphics/remote_access/r4.png")
```

The browser will now open a remote desktop. While it is loading it should look as follows

```{r,  include=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=c(" "), out.width="90%", fig.show='hold',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./graphics/remote_access/r3.png")
```



#### Step 7: Enter your user name and password {-}

Now enter your user name and password. Note depending on how you've logged on to the system, you might not be asked about this, 

```{r,  include=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=c(" "), out.width="90%", fig.show='hold',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./graphics/remote_access/r5.png")
```




#### Step 8: You are  logged in {-}

You should now see Windows desktop within your bwowser 
```{r,  include=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=c(" "), out.width="90%", fig.show='hold',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./graphics/remote_access/r6.png")
```


#### Step 9: You can now use the remote computer {-}

Click on the Windows icon in the lower left corner to open the menu. You can now use the software installed on the UoB desktop. 

```{r,  include=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=c(" "), out.width="90%", fig.show='hold',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./graphics/remote_access/r8.png")
```

####  Saving files remotely {-}

Note that since you are working on a UoB computer, you cannot save and create files everywhere. For example, you cannot save files to the desktop. However, you can save files to your University of Bristol "OneDrive" account:

```{r,  include=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=c(" "), out.width="90%", fig.show='hold',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./graphics/remote_access/r8.png")
```


You can also use Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge within the Windows Virtual Desktop to browse the internet within the browser. If you want to work on a dataset from Eurostat within the  Windows Virtual Desktop the easiest way is to access the Eurostat website within the Windows Virtual Desktop and download the data to the virtual drive.
